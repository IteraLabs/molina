Welcome to the `molina` project, a synthetic research agent for local knowledge representation.

Notice here the absence of the terms `Artificial` and `Intelligence`, this is deliverate.
This is not an `artificially sweetened` project, is not a claim to be the panacea, neither 
the $n-th$ attempt to solve general let alone narrow intelligence because this is definitely
not a claim of something being intelligent. 

What is this then ?, a tool, built with an agentic approach, for you to interact with by the 
act of formulating research-related questions, which will get you responses using *only* the 
academic papers you provide as the *knowledge base*.

The name is in honor to THE greatest Mexican researcher of all times, [Mario Molina (1943-2020)](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Molina_(qu√≠mico)).

## Problems

Challenges of the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), as an academic research assistant, are:  

- Hallucination.
- Lack of domain-specific knowledge.
- Outdated information.
- Bias in Training Data.
- Interpretability and Response Attribution.

## General structure
- pre-retrieval
- retrieval
- post-retrieval
- generation
